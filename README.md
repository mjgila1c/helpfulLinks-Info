# **Helpful Links for Coders**

<h2>Code Louisville Front-End Developer Project</h2>


<h3> Helpful repos, links, blogs and other training platforms to help learn to coding. </h3>

<p>I created this repo to help me and any others interested to remember useful links and other information on how to learn how to code.</p>

<p>While working on my first project with Code Louisville I've found several extremely useful websites and other resources that I found extremely helpful
but I had trouble keeping track of all of them and how to find them when I needed them. So I thought why not make that my project?!

While working this project I've managed to learn how to use the You Tube API, Application Programming Interface, to use Javascript to remove unwanted
information on the video and also to Fade In and Out the video once it was completed or the user decided to replay it. The video is a short video of me
explaining what my website is about and why I built it. 

I had wanted to add more content to the video but I thought it best to keep it under 1 minute. I would also recommend that people use the "human resources"
as much as possible. Whether you have to fortune of joining a great program like **code Louisville** or just learning on your own, you will need help 
from other in the IT community to help you learn. I'd recommend website <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> or <a href="https://www.meetup.com/topics/slack/">Meetup</a> 
 to find a Mentor either online or locally.<br></p>

<p>On this site I've created four catagories of information. All linked references have my comments or someone elses of what they thought of it and why they think its usful.</p>

1) ![Childrens letter blocks stacked, A B and C]("/img/abcBlocks.png")<p>**ABCs of Coding:** The fundmental "buidling blocks" of Coding... at least some of the things I found 
fundmental.</p>

2) ![Globe with graduation cermonial hat and books]("/img/learning-paths.png")<p>**Learning Pathways:** These are more indepth programs that can teach you from A to Z++ about 
the computer language platform you are interested in or the career path you're wanting to pursue.</p>

3) ![Git and Github Logos]("/img/github.png")<p>**Git and Github** A breakdown of what Git and Github is about and why it's important. There are several links to explanations 
on how to use Git and Github to start buiding websites and code while conversing or working with others easily.</p>

4) ![Sticky note "Practice Makes Perfect"]("/img/practiceMakesPerfect.png")<p>**Practice Makes Perfect** A list of sites and programs to help you refine your skills, work with
others on learning new technics and even learning in a game type of formate.</p>

<p>This was supposed to be a simple project but as I got into the programming and learning from my mistakes it became pretty complex ... at least for me anyway. Please feel free
to contribute or offer any advice you may have. Thanks!</p>
